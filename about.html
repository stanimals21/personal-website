			<h1>Howdy!</h1>
			<p>My name is Shawn Tan, and I'm currently an junior undergraduate computer science student. This means that my life is esentially 
                composed of programming assignments and internship applications at the moment (I'm only partially joking). 
                However, when I have free time, I have a variety of activities I choose to partake in. Some of my favorite hobbies 
                include playing competitive tennis, jump-roping, gaming, and sleeping.

            <h3>Tennis</h3>
			<p>
                When I was in high school, the majority of my free time as spent on the tennis court. I was a varsity player for 
                The <a href="https://www.lasahighschool.org/">Liberal Arts and Science Academy</a> and also participated in 
                <a href="https://www.usta.com/en/home.html">USTA tournaments</a> for <a href="https://www.tennisrecruiting.net/player.asp?id=703562">
                state-ranking points</a>. At one point in time, I was ranked 85th in Texas and was traveling at least once a month to participate 
                in <a href="https://www.youthtennistexas.com/super-championship">tournaments</a>, including SCMZs and the annual Texas Slam. Originally, my goal was to play on a competitive college team, but ultimately, I decided to get a degree in 
				computer science instead. Today, I still enjoy playing tennis and am an active member of the A&M Recreational Tennis Team, through which I still
				enter tournaments and compete against other universities.

				<h3>Jump Roping</h3>
				<p>
				Contrary to popular belief, jumping rope is not an activity exclusive to elementary school girls (I swear). It's great for cardio, and can be done
				anywhere for a quick workout. After entering college, playing tennis all the time wasn't really an option, so I used jump-rope exercises
				as an effective	substitute. I have fun performing <a href="https://www.expertboxing.com/boxing-jump-rope-tricks">tricks</a>, and the accessibility/affordability of the jump rope makes it an easy
				way to stay in shape while in school. Also, I hate treadmills.

				<h3>Gaming</h3>
				<p>
				More of a guilty pleasure these days, video games have been one of the biggest time-consumers for me in the past. Although I don't 
				get many chances to play them anymore, the types of video games I enjoy the most are competitive "player vs. player" games 
				(such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or Counter-Strike), and almost anything from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a>.
