				<section class="proj"><h1>Brotherhood of Engineers Participation Tracker</h1>
					<p>	This participation tracker is a web application that allows student members and officers to track and take attendance for organizational events.
                        Working in a group of 5, our team utilized PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails in accordance with MVC design principles to implement RESTful routing and
                        CRUD functionality. Moreover, we successfully deployed application to the public through Heroku, a cloud application platform and
                        leveraged Rspec and Capybara to specific write unit tests that follow TDD practices. Additionally, throughout the development process, the team
                        adhered to agile methodologies by working in two-week sprints and participating in daily standups and bi-weekly
                        grooming meetings.

				<section class="proj"><h1>Movie Database Management System</h1>
					<p>	
                        The 'MDBMS' is a Java-based database management system and graphical user interface, which manages and queries data from a movie 
                        database for students within the College of Liberal Arts. Through the process of working in a team of four, we learned to handle the parsing of SQL-like data, implement data storage/manipulation through
                        object-oriented programming, and utilize JavaFX to design a user-friendly GUI.
					</p>
                </section>
                
                <section class="proj"><h1>Buddy System Memory Allocator</h1>
                    <p>	In this project, I utilized C++ to create a memory manager that models how a Linux kernel would partition, allocate, and free memory
                        for computer processes via the buddy system allocation method. In the process of doing so, I became familiarized with the Linux command line and development tools, such as the g++ compiler command, GDB
                        Debugger, Git, and various navigation/file management commands.</p>
